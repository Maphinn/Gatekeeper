# The port that the server listens on for the udp package from the client.
# Listening udp port:
port=8123

# Ports that need to be shielded.
# Any incomming udp or tcp traffic to these ports will be blocked by the firewall.
# They will only open up once the secret and timestamp verifaction has succeeded.
# Even then they will only open up for the ip address that send the packet.
# The ports here are seperated by comma's
# Protected ports:
prot=21,22,25,80,443

# A secret code that is verified by the server.
# By making sure the secret is unique and not the default.
# This secret will also need to be send by the client.
# Secret:
pass=How do you like them apples?

# locs contains the ip addresses and ranges that should be whitelisted for your setup.
# If you want your server to always allow certain addresses access, use this.
# Local subnets:
locs=192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8

# Time margin in seconds to accept requests.
# To prevent replay attacks a timestamp is added and hashed along with the secret.
# This timestamp is then verified against this specific margin in seconds,
# to prevent replay attacks after some time has passed.
# Time margin
time=10
